<p> Hello all! My name is Hannah. I am a huge animal lover, so I decided to begin pet sitting and dog walking when I was about 11 years old. 
I am now 19, so I've been doing this hobby for about 8 years now. I have done a variety of animals (103 total) including dogs, cats, birds,
hamsters, guinea pigs, lizards, fish, and (yes) beetles. I've always wanted to do something with animals, so I thought of pursuing the Veterinarian
field. After volunteering at a vet hospital for two years, I've decided that the vet field isn't for me... I don't think I can cut an animal open myself. 
I almost passed out while watching a surgery at the hospital. After much thought, I've decided I want to get into the Early Childhood Education field. I 
still love animals and want to do something with them in my future. I was thinking of being a dog trainer in the summers when I'm off from teaching. 
I also plan on having a couple Great Danes and a horse or two when I move out of my parent's house and get my own place :D We currently have two Siberian
Huskies, one cat, and two small parrots. Please let me know if you're interested in any of my pet sitting and dog walking services. I am always happy to meet
new people and their pets. I am in my first year of college, but I'm attending Butler County Community College so I'm still around. If there are days that I'm 
in a class at a time you need your dog let out, my mom has been a huge help with that. When I come to meet your pet, I will bring her along so you can meet her 
and she can meet you and your pet as well. Hope to meet you and your pet(s) very soon :) 
~Hannah~
